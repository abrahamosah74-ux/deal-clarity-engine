### Example
```
Subject: Following up on {{dealName}}

Hi {{contactName}},

I wanted to check in about {{dealName}}...
```

When you use this template, `{{contactName}}` might become "John Smith" and `{{dealName}}` might become "CRM Implementation".

### Available Variable Types

**Contact Info**:
- {{contactName}}
- {{contactEmail}}
- {{contactPhone}}

**Deal/Opportunity**:
- {{dealName}}
- {{dealValue}}
- {{dealStage}}

**Company Info**:
- {{companyName}}

**Dates & Times**:

## Creating Your Own Templates

**Tip**: Start with a preset as a foundation, then customize it—faster than creating from scratch!
